# ðŸŽ² Dice Roller

A simple dice roller I built to practice JavaScript! Perfect for when you lose your dice during game night.

## What it does

- Roll 1-6 dice at once
- Shows results as numbers and dice images
- Clean interface that's easy to use

## Built with

- HTML for the structure
- CSS for styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for the fun stuff

## How to use it

1. Download the files
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Pick how many dice you want (1-6)
4. Hit "Roll Dice" and see what you get!

Make sure you have the dice images in a `dice_images` folder (1.png through 6.png).

## How it works

Pretty straightforward - I use `Math.random()` to generate numbers 1-6, then show both the numbers and matching dice images. The main function grabs your input, rolls the dice, and updates the page.

## Files you need

```
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # The main page
â”œâ”€â”€ diceroller.js       # Where the magic happens
â”œâ”€â”€ s10.css            # Makes it look nice
â””â”€â”€ dice_images/       # Your dice pictures
```

## Want to change something?

Go for it! You could:
- Add more dice types (D20 anyone?)
- Make it look prettier
- Add sound effects
- Fix that typo where I wrote "numbers" instead of "number" ðŸ˜…

## That's it!

Simple project, but it was fun to build and actually useful. Sometimes the best way to learn is by making something you'd actually use.

Happy rolling! ðŸŽ²
